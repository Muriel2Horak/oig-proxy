## Detailed Check Results

### ✅ CHECK 1: No Feb 16, 2026 data - PASS
**Status:** PASS
**Evidence:** .sisyphus/evidence/f2-check1-no-today-data.txt
**Findings:** 
- Both payloads.db and payloads_ha_full.db are empty (0 bytes, no tables)
- No frames table exists in either database
- Feb 16, 2026 data count: 0 in both databases
**Compliance:** ✓ Mock server data (Feb 16, 2026) properly excluded

### ❌ CHECK 2: No proxy code changes - FAIL
**Status:** FAIL  
**Evidence:** .sisyphus/evidence/f2-check2-no-code-changes.txt
**Findings:**
- Modified files detected in addon/oig-proxy/ directory:
  * control_settings.py: 49 changes (+47, -8) 
  * proxy.py: 6 changes (+6, -0)
- Changes include enhanced ACK handling, logging improvements, and connection tracking
- Last commit: 7af92c3 (fix: resolve IsNewSet interception)
**Compliance:** ✗ VIOLATION - Proxy code changes detected
**Impact:** This violates scope requirement "No live debugging or proxy code changes"

### ✅ CHECK 3: All verdicts backed by numbers - PASS
**Status:** PASS
**Evidence:** .sisyphus/evidence/f2-check3-verdikt-numbers.txt
**Findings:**
- H2 (SUPPORTED): Backed by extensive numbers (747, 26,857 frames, length distributions)
- H4 (REFUTED): Backed by concrete numbers (209 Settings, 767 ACKs)
- H1/H3 (INCONCLUSIVE): Appropriately explained without requiring numbers
- Additional evidence: timing data, frame counts, statistical analysis
**Compliance:** ✓ All SUPPORTED/REFUTED verdicts properly backed by concrete numbers

### ✅ CHECK 4: Report in Czech - PASS
**Status:** PASS
**Evidence:** .sisyphus/evidence/f2-check4-czech-lang.txt
**Findings:**
- 393 Czech characters across 17 different diacritical marks
- Czech section headers: 6/7 (85.7%)
- Czech subsection headers: 17/21 (81.0%)
- Rich Czech language usage throughout explanatory text
**Compliance:** ✓ Report definitively in Czech with proper character usage

### ✅ CHECK 5: Action plan present - PASS
**Status:** PASS
**Evidence:** .sisyphus/evidence/f2-check5-action-plan.txt
**Findings:**
- "## Akční plán" section exists
- 4 detailed steps (exceeds minimum 3 requirement)
- "Krok 1/2/3" pattern properly followed
- Each step includes: specific action, description, priority level
- Additional fallback step provided
**Compliance:** ✓ Action plan exceeds requirements with comprehensive 4-step approach

## FINAL VERDICT: REJECT

### Rationale for Rejection:
While 4 out of 5 checks pass successfully, **CHECK 2 FAILED** due to proxy code changes detected in the addon/oig-proxy/ directory. This represents a clear violation of the scope requirement "No live debugging or proxy code changes" as specified in the inherited wisdom from the analysis plan.

### Critical Violation Details:
- **Files Modified:** control_settings.py (49 changes), proxy.py (6 changes)  
- **Nature of Changes:** Enhanced ACK handling, logging improvements, connection tracking
- **Scope Impact:** Direct modification of proxy code violates analysis boundaries

### Recommendations:
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Revert proxy code changes to restore scope compliance
2. **RE-RUN:** Conduct new scope fidelity check after reversion
3. **FUTURE:** Ensure strict adherence to "no proxy code changes" requirement during analysis

### Positive Aspects Noted:
- Excellent data exclusion compliance (no Feb 16, 2026 data)
- Strong numerical backing for all verdicts
- High-quality Czech language implementation  
- Comprehensive and actionable plan development

### Evidence Files Generated:
All evidence saved to .sisyphus/evidence/ directory:
- f2-check1-no-today-data.txt
- f2-check2-no-code-changes.txt  
- f2-check3-verdikt-numbers.txt
- f2-check4-czech-lang.txt
- f2-check5-action-plan.txt
